# The Odin Project: Recipes
This repository is the Recipes page project from The Odin Project.

This project is located in the HTML Foundations section of the Foundations Track. 
It will demonstrate what I've learned so far regarding HTML basics:
- Links
- Images
- Boilerplate code
- Lists
- Text
- Elements
- Tags

The three recipes featured are fettuccine alfredo pasta, mushroom stroganoff, and penne alla vodka.
